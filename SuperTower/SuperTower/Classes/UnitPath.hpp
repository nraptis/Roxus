//Rule: U can't place any tower iff
// 1.) It blocks a "level path" from reaching its destination.
// 2.) It prevents any unit from reaching its destination...
// -------
// C.) As a result of rules 1 and 2, it is possible for a unit to be "cut off"
// from the "level path" is was originally following.


//Some observations which we must handle:
//1.) The "unit path" can stray somewhat far from the "level path" especially
//when going around gnarly diagonals and funky corners..
//2.) The unit path cannot be permenantly attached to the level path because it
//is possible to "cut off" a unit (See C)
//3.) It is also possible for a "cut off" unit to wander back onto the "level path"
//as it wanders in "free mode"
